## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical implementation

### Environment

- Developed using VS Code.
- Git and GitHub for version control.
- Project runs fully in the browser using static files.

### Backend

- Basic Node.js server created (`server.js`).
- No dynamic backend yet ‚Äî games are frontend-driven.

### Frontend

- Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Each game (e.g., Blackjack) has its own HTML file (`blackjack.html`).

**Example navigation from `index.html`:**

```html
<a href="blackjack.html" class="btn blackjack">BLACKJACK</a>
```

### Architecture and Files

Flat project structure:

```
/ (root)
| server.js
| package.json
| /public
  | index.html
  | blackjack.html
  | blackjack.js
  | slots.html
  | slots.js
  | styles.css
  | script.js
  | terms.html
| /node_modules
```

- JavaScript handles game logic.
- HTML pages link to corresponding JS and CSS files.

### Functionality Example

In Blackjack, when the player clicks "Ota kortti", the `hit()` function is called:

```javascript
function hit() {
    playerCards.push(deck.pop());
    const score = calculateScore(playerCards);
    if (score > 21) {
        updateView('H√§visit! Yli 21.');
    } else {
        updateView('Ota lis√§√§ tai j√§√§.');
    }
}
```

## üöÇ Development process

- **Phase 1:** Planned user personas, user flows, and UI sketches.
- **Phase 2:**
  - Created static HTML and CSS templates.
  - Developed Blackjack game logic.
  - Built a basic Node.js server to serve static files.
  - Planned MongoDB usage for future score tracking (not yet implemented).
- Agile practices: regular check-ins and task updates on GitHub.

---

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and future work

### What worked well

- Clear separation of game logic and UI.
- Smooth gameplay experience using simple browser technologies.

### Challenges

- Handling dynamic score calculations in Blackjack correctly.
- Deciding to delay backend database integration to stay within project scope.

### Future improvements

- Implement user login and persistent score saving with MongoDB.
- Improve mobile responsiveness.
- Add animations and sound effects to games.
